    <p>Thank you for the visit! It's a pleasure talking to you about work and life.

Started the journey with freelancing and helped small businesses managing data.
Freelancing taught me dealing with ambiguity.

At C-DAC got a chance to master software craftsmanship.
Helped our clients with a minimal viable software first and, incrementally added features to the product.
This product rewarded me a full-stack web development experience with leadership skills.

Wells Fargo introduced me to FinTech. Here, the FinTech web services platform demands thinking in systems and communicating with many stakeholders.

I enjoy a workout and some reading regularly to surf through the chaos.

Please feel free to strike up a conversation. </p>
